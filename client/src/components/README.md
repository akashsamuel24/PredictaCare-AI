# PredictaCare Demo (Frontend + Mock Backend)

This is a demo project to showcase PredictaCare AI interface and flows.

## Requirements
- Node.js (14+)

## Run locally
1. Install root deps:
npm install
2. Setup client:

cd client
npm install
cd ..
3. Start server and client concurrently:
npm run start
4. Open http://localhost:3000

The server runs on http://localhost:5000 and returns deterministic demo predictions and booking responses.

This is a **demo/mock** codebase for presentation. The prediction logic is intentionally simplified and not a medical diagnostic. Do not use for real medical advice.
